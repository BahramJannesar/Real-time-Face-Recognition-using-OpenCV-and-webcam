# Real-time-Face-Recognition-using-OpenCV-and-webcam

Face detection means that the machine can identify that there is a human face present in the video and Face recognition can confirm the identity of that person. 

I use OpenCV library in Python to do a real-time Face recognition using the computer webcam.

Face detection is done using feature-based cascade classifiers.
